## 1) Executive Summary

- Overall delivery performance degraded this week. Throughput fell sharply from 64 to 26 completed items, while median cycle time increased from 75 to 81 hours, indicating slower delivery across the system. At the same time, total work in progress remains extremely high at 791 items, suggesting the system is overloaded and work is not flowing efficiently.

- Blocked share decreased slightly from 3.06% to 2.83%, indicating marginal improvement in blocker resolution, and no completed issues were reopened this week. However, these improvements are outweighed by the significant reduction in throughput and increased delivery time.

- The primary risk is excessive work in progress, which is likely reducing focus and slowing completion. The recommended action is to prioritize finishing existing work and actively triage the oldest in-progress and blocked items, rather than starting new work.

- Confidence in this assessment is high, as multiple independent flow metrics show consistent signs of congestion.

- The key metric to monitor next week is throughput recovery relative to WIP reduction.
